what is dev-ops ?
Dev-ops is a set of tools and practices designed to shorten the software development lifecycle process and soft and efficency manner  .

How to move ahead in the competitive market ?
How to provide best feture to the end -users in set time?

1 Faster deployment 2 stablized work environment 3 Imporved product quality 4 automation 5 Agility  6 continous delivery



Dev-ops Skills 

Fundmental linux command --- 

git and git hub ---   git is version control system / git hub web base repository host the service  web interface to upolad the file  / git is software for coordinating work among the progarmmers collabortively developing source code 

CI-CD WITH JENKINS  --- jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate and support continours integarion and continouse delivery (CI -CD )

SELENIUM  ---- SELENIUM is a protable framework for conducting automation testing 

ANSIBLE  ---- configuration mangement using anisble 

01 configuration mangment  2 cloud pro0vising 3 application depolyment 4 intra- service orchestration 

DOCKER --- containeriztion method that allow developers to create the depoly files more quickly and secuely 

01 Docker is a paltform as a service prodoct that delivery software in containders using  OS-Level virtualiztion 
 

NAGIOS ---  evkyate the most suitable tools for ciontinouse monitoring   like risk complinace security issues  

NAGIOS is an open source continous monitoring tool used to maontioru the system network and IT Ingrastrucutre 


AKS --- Grasp the fact theat container orchestriotn makes devlopment and opertions more mangeable 

aks is a powerful open -source orchestration paltform designed to manage containerized applications




Linux basic command  and introuction of linx 

Linux is an operating system that manges the communtion between and hardware of system 
and is introuce by the linux tarvalds 

compunents of linux OS : BOTTLOADER --A SOFTWARE TO MANGE THE BOOTING PROCESS OF A COMPUTER THAT MOSTLY 
                         COMES AS A SPLASH SCREEN TO BOOT INTO AN OS 

kERNEL : THE CORE OF SYSTEM THAT MANGES CPU MEMORY AND PERPHERAL DEVICES AND IS THE BASIC LEVEL OF AN OS 

INIT SYSTEM : A SUBSYTEM THAT BOOT STRAPS THE USER SPACE AND CHARGES WITH CONTROLLING DAEMONS 

DAEMONS : BACKGROUND SERVES SUCH AS PRINTING SOUND AND SCHEDULING LOG INFOMRATION WATCHING THE INFORMATION MOVE AND MANGING OF LOG 

GRAPHICAL SERVER : A SUBSYSTEM TO DISPLAY GRAPHICS ON THE MONITOR COMMONLY REFERED AS AN X SERVER OR X 

DESKTOP ENVIORMNET : THE CONPOINET WITH WHICH USER INTERACT THE  MOST AND INCLUDES BUILD IN APPLICATION 

APPLICATION : HIGH QUALITY SOFTWARE APPLICATION CAN BE EASILY FOUND USING APP STORE LIKE TOOLS THAT SIMPLIFY APPLICATION INSTALLASTION

IMPORTANT OF LINXU IN DEVOPS 

FASTER DEVELOPMENT ON LINUX 
OPEN SOURCE 
FLEXIBLE 
SCALABLE

02 DISASTER RECOVERY 
03 NEW SYSTEM BUILDS 
04 HARDWARE SOFTWARE AND USER MAINTENACNE 
05 FILE SYTEM HOUSEKEEPING 
06 APPLICATION INSTALTION AND CONFIGURATION 



what is dev-ops 
It is a set of parcites that aims to provide superior quality software quickly by integaring the processs between the development and the operations teams 

it is interation process between the devopment and openation  so their build test and depoly and realse the software in more efficency manner and faster mannner 

what is devops aims 
Shortens development life cycle  
provides fetures and fixes 
provides reqular updates 

Dev : plan create  verify  package    PLAN  CREATE TEST DEPOLY    
OPS : RELASE CONFIGURE  MONITOR

Dev-ops lifecycle  

continous development :   developer build the code and plan the code dev-ops need not required planing  serveral tools for code mainting 

continous testing     :   It is use of bug automation test TestNG : TestNG GENERATES REPORTS     JUNIT          SELENIUM: SELENIUM IMPLEMENTS THE AUTOMATION TESTING    

continous intergation  : UNIT TESTING  INTEGRATION TESTING  CODE REVIEW   CODE PACKAGING
